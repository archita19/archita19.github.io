title:  "Shopify agrees to consumer safety tweaks in Europe"
---

Shopify has agreed to make changes linked to shopper safety and combating fakes after a regulatory intervention in the European Union following a number of complaints, the Commission said today.

The changes agreed to include a commitment to create a “fast and effective” ‘notice and action’ procedure for national consumer authorities to report problems they spot; and an agreement to change its templates to encourage traders to be more transparent with consumers.

Per the EU, the complaints — which it said peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic — mainly related to web stores hosted by the B2B e-commerce platform which were found to have engaged in illegal practices, such as making fake offers and fake scarcity claims; supplying counterfeit goods; or not providing their contact details.

It said Shopify has agreed to take down shops when concerns are raised with it by national consumer protection authorities in the EU — and to provide “relevant company details” to the regulators.

As regards its templates, the EU said Shopify has committed to including fields for company information and contact details in templates for web shops’ contact pages and generators for Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policies and Refund Policies.

It has also agreed to provide clear guidance to traders on applicable EU consumer law, it added.

The background here is the EU launched a dialogue with Shopify in July 2021 in conjunction with the EU’s network of national consumer protection (CPC) authorities to press Shopify to make changes to address illegal practices of traders on its platform.
